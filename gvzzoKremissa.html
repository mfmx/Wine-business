<pre align="center" id="kremissaParagraph">According to the legend, Kremissa was founded by Filottete on his way back from the trotian's war.  <br>
The town was populated by local indigenous tribes and Greeks.  <br>
The Greeks which lived in those areas during the Magna Graecia period, were call Oenotrians.<br> 
A likely derivation of the ethnonym Oenotrian would be the Greek oivoc (oinos), "wine", as the Oenotrians<br> inhabited a territory rich in vineyards, with Oenotria being extended to refer to the entirety of Southern Italy.<br>
Many theories found this historic site as one of the most important in the Calabria region. <br>
Due to its perfect location was not only a perfect ground for wine making but also for commerce and trades. <br>
Today Kremissa is call Cir√≤, has a population of about 15,000 people, and still today keeps a florent tradition in wine making.  <br>Krimissa wine was well known in the history from the Magna Graecia throught the Roman Empire, and luckily still<br> today preserve a strong a well respected name in the business.  </pre>
